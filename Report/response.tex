\section{Response to the reviewers}
We have placed the reviewers comments in \textit{\textbf{Italics and Bold}} and our response to those comments in plain text.

\subsection{Review 1 (Reviewer A)}
\paragraph*{\textit{When listing objects in  II.A the default gray empty square should also be mentioned.}}
We have added a definition for the \emph{Floor}.
\paragraph*{\textit{In the definition of 'Walls' the word 'Walls' appears instead of 'Doors'.}}
We have corrected the typo in the definition of \emph{Walls} in the problem domain section.
\paragraph*{\textit{When specifying that closed 'Doors' are blue there should be mention of the color of open 'Doors' (I assume gray).}}
We have changed the description of \emph{Doors} to better reflect what they look like when open.
\paragraph*{\textit{It is unclear if 'Door' closes again when agent on button moves on (or, alternatively, if walking onto a 'Button' effectively destroy the 'Door').}}
We have improved the definition for \emph{Door} in order to make it clearer that the \emph{Door} closes again when the \emph{Buttons} are no longer activated.
\paragraph*{\textit{Since 'Agents' are described as dark yellow, and since there are only two shades of yellow used, it would be wiser to describe a 'Goal' as rendered in bright yellow.}}
We have reworded the definition of \emph{Goal} to better describe the colour in relation to \emph{Agents}.
\subsection{Review 2 (Reviewer D)}
\subsection{Review 3 (Reviewer G)}
\paragraph*{\textit{What is "Uniform Cost applied to Trees"? Is it something similar to the famous "Upper Confidence bound applied to Trees"? If not, please cite something.}}
We have corrected the incorrect definition of UCT from Uniform Cost over Trees to Upper Confidence bound applied to Trees.
\paragraph*{\textit{Is the problem domain a real time problem? How long is a tick? 40ms? Do all agents return an action within a tick?}}
The definition of the problem domain has been improved with a section describing the particular way that actions are collected and executed as well as a list of each possible action that can be chosen.
\paragraph*{\textit{If an agent reaches a goal, is it known to the other agents?}}
We have clarified whether the \emph{Agents} are aware that other \emph{Agents} reach a \emph{Goal}.
\paragraph*{\textit{Do agents see all areas of the problem?}}
We have clarified how the problem domain handles observability and what information the \emph{Agents} have access to.
\paragraph*{\textit{Who created this problem domain?}}
We have clarified who created the problem domain.
\paragraph*{\textit{"Doors are rendered in Black." -> "Walls are rendered in Black."}}
We have corrected the typo in the definition of \emph{Walls} in the problem domain section.
\subsection{Review 4 (Reviewer B)}
\paragraph*{\textit{there is some mixup with agents being labeled 0 and 1 in the figures, but 1 and 2 in the text.}}

\paragraph*{\textit{I did not understand the terms "UCT border" and "rollout border". Explain them. Are they related to "Max UCT" and "Max Rollout" in Fig. 2 ?}}
\paragraph*{\textit{What does 1+1 ES mean?}}
\paragraph*{\textit{I did not quite understand how your MCTS works with multiple agents. Are you running independent simulations for each agent (I assume yes but it was not clear)? }}
\paragraph*{\textit{I would like to see results for mixed agent teams.}}
\paragraph*{\textit{The issue of communication, especially learning communication, is very important and I suggest you focus on this for future research.}}
\subsection{Review 5 (Reviewer F)}
\paragraph*{\textit{The early segments fail to really discuss the MCTS algorithm.  The abbreviation for this is also found in the abstract and should really be in the introductory paragraph.}}
\paragraph*{\textit{Section II covering preliminary tests is light on technical details and seem ill placed when you consider the subsequent studies later on in the paper.}}
\paragraph*{\textit{The third page could do with being structured better.  The charts are ill-placed, do not help the flow of the authors argument and need better captions.}}
\paragraph*{\textit{The paper would benefit from showing the actual levels used as part of the testing.  Given it makes it harder to understand the impact of later levels.  Figure 10 should be shown much earlier in the paper.}}
\paragraph*{\textit{The selection of controller types does strike me as odd.  With a random selected and a Variable MAGA that is introduced to resolve shortcoming of the other.  What about a simple 1+1 ES without the macro's?  Or the likes of an A* bot?  Could these not be implemented?}}
\paragraph*{\textit{More than once the idea of a language through which to communicate is discussed, but it has no real impact on this paper and should really be saved for when it is explored}}
