\subsection{Review 1 (Reviewer A)}
We have corrected the typo in the definition of \emph{Walls} in the problem domain section.

We have changed the description of \emph{Doors} to better reflect what they look like when open.

We have added a definition for the \emph{Floor}.

We have improved the definition for \emph{Door} in order to make it clearer that the \emph{Door} closes again when the \emph{Buttons} are no longer activated.

We have reworded the definition of \emph{Goal} to better describe the colour in relation to \emph{Agents}.
\subsection{Review 2 (Reviewer D)}
\subsection{Review 3 (Reviewer G)}
We have corrected the incorrect definition of UCT from Uniform Cost over Trees to Upper Confidence bound applied to Trees.

We have corrected the typo in the definition of \emph{Walls} in the problem domain section.

The definition of the problem domain has been improved with a section describing the particular way that actions are collected and executed as well as a list of each possible action that can be chosen.
