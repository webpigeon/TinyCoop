 The inclusion of MAGA was criticised because of lack of optimisation, so authors may want to specify that
 comparison with MAGA was not the main point of the paper (otherwise it's a sort of cheating comparing performance
 with a non-optimised algorithm). 


- In general the authors addressed well all reviewer's comments, however much of the explanation given was addressed directly to the reviewers rather than included in the paper, for example last question of Reviewer 1 (regarding "random strategy"), or Reviewer 3 ("In what sense this domain interesting compared to other domains?", "If all information is visible to the agents, this problem domain seems not so interesting especially if both agents are the same", "I don't think GA is suitable for this domain. Comparing against A*search with a simple evaluation function would be more interesting") or Reviewer 5 ("What about a simple 1+1 ES without the macros? Or the likes of an A* bot? Could these not be implemented?"). I think that the authors are missing an opportunity of further explain the value of their research by not including the well presented explanations (maybe in the discussion section?).

DONE
*****
- Please change all the "it's"--> it is, "can't"-->cannot, etc. etc.
- A minor comment, please change the first sentence of section I (Page 1) from "This research problem that this paper will assess is.." to "The research problem assessed in this paper is" as is oddly constructed.
- The discussion should be a whole section by itself, not a subsection of the results.
- MCTS in the title should be changed to "Monte Carlo Tree Search". Same in the abstract (also highlighted by one of the reviewers, at least the first time they mention it). 
- The conclusions are still very very short. They should recap part of the dicussion.
